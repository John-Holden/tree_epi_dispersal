______Simulation Parameters_______
model : exp
alpha : 5(m)
ell : 25(m)
L : 400X400
rhos : [0.0, 0.10000000000000001] | 51
betas : [0.0, 0.02] | 11
core repeats : 4
percolation boundary : True
Notes : '~ double the gaussian. at this point i don't have an answer as to why the r0 for the exp model is ~2 x r0 for
           the gaussian, given that the analytical r0 should integrate to the same ? anyway there you have it.
           Exp roughly 2 \times faster'
